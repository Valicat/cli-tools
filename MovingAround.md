Moving around in Bash
=====================

## print working directory

One of the hardest things to get a handle on with working in the terminal is to figure out where you are on your computer. It's important, because you can run commands on any file on your computer from where you are, but you gotta know where that is before you can do so. So, do this:

`$ pwd`

That should tell you where you are in your computer's file system. When I launch a new shell and type that in, I get this:

`/Users/christian`

That tells me I'm in my own user directory. I bet you are in yours, but do it and see.

## list directory

Do this:

`$ ls`

``` Bash
christian:~$ pwd
/Users/christian
christian:~$ ls
