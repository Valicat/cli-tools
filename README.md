Introduction to command-line tools
==================================

This lesson is a beginner's guide to using command-line tools for data-journalism. It is designed for students who may have never used Terminal before.

Some of this lesson is cribbed from the book [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) by Learn Code the Hard Way.

## Macintosh

Oh, you are so lucky. Since Macs are Unix-based, you have everything you need already on your computer to get started with some command-line fun.

Look for a program called `Terminal` on your computer. (Or, you can download [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), which is the program I use. For our purposes, it makes no difference.)

It'll look something like this:

## PCs

For the PCs, we'll use a program called `Windows Powershell`. Go to your Windows Start menu and search for `Powershell` and you should be able to find it.

## Bash

So, Terminal and Powershell are programs that can run a **shell**, which is the user interface your computer understands. The default language for these interactions is called **Bash**. All these crazy [commands](Commands.md) I'm going to teach you are Bash commands.
